Opera's topology file is generated by using Opera's original codebase.

Run MAIN.m in Matlab, and we will have dynexp_1path_N=108_k=12_G=1.txt, which is Opera (k=1).

For fair comparison, we need to change Opera's reconfiguration time. Simply change the second line with "324 49880000 620000 10000" and we can generate dynexp_50us_10nsrc_1path.txt

Note that due to the randomness when generating Opera's topology, the file can be different.

We were not able to use Opera's original codebase to generate the 5-path version, and we could only obtain the raw 5-path file from Opera's github webpage.
This file (dynexp_50us_10nsrc_5paths.txt) is too big and we provide a link for downloading: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B7F3yTlNVO7C7kCwY9ym055iDyM8XVNq/view
