Sirius changes:

-New max packer size (1100?)

-At most 1 data packet sent per slice
-> Routing should not enqueue more than 1125 bytes per slice (new max queue size?)
-> How do we treat queueing now? Should we use CALENDARCLEAR? (now when slice changes link is gone)

-Slice is 100ns but has 90ns availability + 10ns reconfig (need to change routing/queues to account for reconfig?)
